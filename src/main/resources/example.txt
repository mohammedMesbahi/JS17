Fishermen in Morocco are grappling with an unprecedented shortage of sardines this November, a problem exacerbated by the continued rise in market prices.

Industry sources report that fishing boats are returning empty-handed from their trips, with the situation worsening daily. The shortage is largely attributed to overfishing by both domestic and foreign vessels, particularly those from Russia.

Adil Sandadi, deputy coordinator of the National Fisheries Union in the southern region of Dakhla-Oued Eddahab, described the situation as “serious and unprecedented,” pointing out that the depletion of sardines and other surface fish has left local fishermen with little to catch.

He explained that large foreign fishing fleets are rapidly depleting the sardine stocks, causing a sharp decline in fish availability along Moroccan shores. Sandadi also noted that while sardines are typically scarce during November and December, the problem has reached alarming levels in 2024.

The scarcity of sardines, often called “the fish of the poor,” has caused a surge in local prices, according to Sandadi, who said the issue is compounded by intermediaries controlling the remaining fish in the market. In southern regions, sardines are diverted for industrial processing, further limiting local supply.
